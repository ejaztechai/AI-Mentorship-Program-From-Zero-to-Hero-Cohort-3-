## 🎯 About the Program

The AI From Zero to Hero Mentorship Program is designed to take you from a beginner with no experience in AI to mastering advanced concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This cohort follows a **20-week intensive schedule** divided into three distinct learning phases, culminating in a final project. Each phase is designed to build upon the last, ensuring a strong, sequential grasp of AI principles.

**Crucially, every week of learning will conclude with a live session for knowledge evaluation and Q&A.** The final week(s) of each phase are dedicated to **hands-on project sessions** to ensure practical mastery of the concepts.
